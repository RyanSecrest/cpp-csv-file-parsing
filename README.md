The purpose of this project is to teach people how to parse csv files in c++.
A common issue when importing data from csv files into your projects is that the csv file itself can be badly formatted. You will learn how to combat these issues.

This project folder comes with 2 classes which do not need to be altered. You only need to change the code in main to fit your specific csv file.
